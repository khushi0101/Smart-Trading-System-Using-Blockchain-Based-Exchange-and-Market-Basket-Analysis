## Performace Metrics

### The application passes all tests on local blockchain (Ganache network):

The application thus deployed on a public blockchain network makes it convenient for both the vendors and consumers to buy and sell goods. It empowers local vendors to generate greater profits and allows consumers to buy according to their needs without inconvenience. The application uses NextJS for server side rendering that allows the application to perform well and reduces the waiting time on the client side. Server side rendering also allows clients to use the same application on simpler machines that cannot handle complexities.
### Product requests with product details:

### User wallet opens as the application starts:

### User can look through product details and contribute to products:

### The users can also make specific requests and see the number of approvers:

Therefore, the users can trustfully perform all operations among each other without the need for central authorities. Rendering with NextJS allows the clients to view the homepage first before having to install the wallet (for first-time users). This gives a greater incentive for users to use the application. This application very uniquely provides an exclusive space where consumers and vendors can communicate about their requirements. Local vendors can thus generate greater profits  and are more empowered as compared to the status quo, as theyâ€™ll have better  access to user requirements. The app, therefore, helps in building better, efficient functional economies that generate greater revenue.
